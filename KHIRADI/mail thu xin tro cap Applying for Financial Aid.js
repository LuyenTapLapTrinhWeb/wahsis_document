Subject: Applying for Financial Aid Nanjing University Software Testing course
Dear Professors,
I am applying for this course because I really don't have enough money to pay for it. In addition to the money to sustain my life and housing, I would like to have more money to invest in my own favorite course like this one. But I can't do it now. Please review and subsidize the professors. 
Regards,
Sok Kim Thanh`

`Dear Professors
I would answer the question: "How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?"
If I complete this course, I will have a better understanding of software testing. I am a programmer myself and I want to improve my code writing experience.
Thanks very much`
