In this step, you will add a clickable phone image swapper to the phone details page.

The phone details view displays one large image of the current phone and several smaller thumbnail images.
It would be great if we could replace the large image with any of the thumbnails just by clicking on the desired thumbnail image.
Let's have a look at how we can do this with AngularJS.

In the phoneDetail component's controller, we created the mainImageUrl model property and set its default value to the first phone image URL.

We also created a setImage() method (to be used as event handler), that will change the value of mainImageUrl.
