Similar to the ngClick directive, which binds an AngularJS expression to the click event,
there are built-in directives for all native events, such as dblclick, focus/blur, mouse and key events, etc.

Let's add a new controller method to the phoneDetail component's controller:

self.onDblclick = function onDblclick(imageUrl) {
  alert('You double-clicked image: ' + imageUrl);
};
and add the following to the <img> element in phone-detail.template.html:

<img ... ng-dblclick="$ctrl.onDblclick(img)" />
Now, whenever you double-click on a thumbnail, an alert pops-up. Pretty annoying!
