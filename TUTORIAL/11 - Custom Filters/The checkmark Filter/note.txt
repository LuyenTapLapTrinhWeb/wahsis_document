Since this filter is generic (i.e. it is not specific to any view or component),
    we are going to register it in a core module,
    which contains "application-wide" features.

As you may have noticed, we (unsurprisingly) gave our file a .filter suffix.

The name of our filter is "checkmark".
    The input evaluates to either true or false,
    and we return one of the two unicode characters we have chosen to represent true (\u2713 -> ✓) and false (\u2718 -> ✘).

Now that our filter is ready, we need to register the core module as a dependency of our main phonecatApp module.
