The routing functionality added in this step is provided by AngularJS in the ngRoute module, which is distributed separately from the core AngularJS framework.

Since we are using npm to install client-side dependencies, this step updates the package.json configuration file to include the new dependency:

The new dependency "angular-route": "1.7.x" tells npm to install a version of the angular-route module that is compatible with version 1.7.x of AngularJS. We must tell npm to download and install this dependency.
