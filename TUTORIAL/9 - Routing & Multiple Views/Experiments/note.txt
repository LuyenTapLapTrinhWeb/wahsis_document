Try to add a {{$ctrl.phoneId}} binding in the template string for the phone details view:

when('/phones/:phoneId', {
  template: '{{$ctrl.phoneId}} <phone-detail></phone-detail>'
...
You will see that nothing happens, even when you are in the phone details view. 
This is because the phoneId model is visible only in the context set by the phoneDetail component. 
Again, component isolation at work!
