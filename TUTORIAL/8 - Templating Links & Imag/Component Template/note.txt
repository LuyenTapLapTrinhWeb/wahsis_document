To dynamically generate links that will in the future lead to phone detail pages, we used the now-familiar double-curly brace binding in the href attribute values. In step 2, we added the {{phone.name}} binding as the element content. In this step the {{phone.id}} binding is used in the element attribute.
We also added phone images next to each record using an image tag with the ngSrc directive. That directive prevents the browser from treating the AngularJS {{ expression }} markup literally, and initiating a request to an invalid URL (http://localhost:8000/{{phone.imageUrl}}), which it would have done if we had only specified an attribute binding in a regular src attribute (<img src="{{phone.imageUrl}}">).
Using the ngSrc directive, prevents the browser from making an HTTP request to an invalid location.
