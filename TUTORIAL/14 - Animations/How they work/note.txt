Animations in AngularJS are completely based on CSS classes. 
As long as you have a CSS class attached to an HTML element within your application, 
you can apply animations to it. 
Let's say for example that we have an HTML template with a repeater like so:

<div ng-repeat="item in items" class="repeated-item">
  {{ item.id }}
</div>

As you can see, 
    the repeated-item class is present on the element that will be repeated and this class will be used as a reference within our 
    application's CSS and/or JavaScript animation code to tell AngularJS to perform an animation.

As ngRepeat does its thing, each time a new item is added into the list, ngRepeat will add an ng-enter class to the element that is being added. 
    When removed it will apply an ng-leave class and when moved around it will apply an ng-move class.

Taking a look at the following CSS code, 
    we can see some transition and keyframe animation code set up for each of those events that occur when ngRepeat triggers them:

/*
  We are using CSS transitions for when the enter and move events
  are triggered for the element that has the `repeated-item` class
*/
.repeated-item.ng-enter, .repeated-item.ng-move {
  transition: all 0.5s linear;
  opacity: 0;
}

/*
  `.ng-enter-active` and `.ng-move-active` are where the transition destination
  properties are set so that the animation knows what to animate
*/
.repeated-item.ng-enter.ng-enter-active,
.repeated-item.ng-move.ng-move-active {
  opacity: 1;
}

/*
  We are using CSS keyframe animations for when the `leave` event
  is triggered for the element that has the `repeated-item` class
*/
.repeated-item.ng-leave {
  animation: 0.5s my_animation;
}

@keyframes my_animation {
  from { opacity: 1; }
  to   { opacity: 0; }
}

With these generated CSS class names present on the element at the time, 
    AngularJS automatically figures out whether to perform a CSS and/or JavaScript animation.
    Note that you can't have both CSS and JavaScript animations based on the same CSS class. See here for more details.
