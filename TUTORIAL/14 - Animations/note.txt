In this step, 
we will enhance our web application by adding CSS and JavaScript animations on top of the template code we created earlier.

We now use the ngAnimate module to enable animations throughout the application.
We also rely on built-in directives to automatically trigger hooks for animations to tap into.
When an animation is found, 
it will run along with the actual DOM operation that is being issued on the element at the given time 
(e.g. inserting/removing nodes on ngRepeat or adding/removing classes on ngClass).
