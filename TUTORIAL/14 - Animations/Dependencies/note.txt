The animation functionality is provided by AngularJS in the ngAnimate module, 
which is distributed separately from the core AngularJS framework. 
In addition we will use jQuery in this project to do extra JavaScript animations.

Since we are using npm to install client-side dependencies, 
this step updates the package.json configuration file to include the new dependencies:

package.json:

{
  "name": "angular-phonecat",
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "angular": "1.7.x",
    "angular-animate": "1.7.x",
    "angular-resource": "1.7.x",
    "angular-route": "1.7.x",
    "bootstrap": "3.3.x",
    "jquery": "3.3.x"
  },
  ...
}
"angular-animate": "1.7.x" tells npm to install a version of the angular-animate module that is compatible with version 1.7.x of AngularJS.
"jquery": "3.3.x" tells npm to install the latest patch release of the 3.3 version of jQuery. Note that this is not an AngularJS library; it is the standard jQuery library. We can use npm to install a wide range of 3rd party libraries.
Now, we must tell npm to download and install these dependencies.

npm install

Now that our application is "animation aware", let's create some fancy animations!
