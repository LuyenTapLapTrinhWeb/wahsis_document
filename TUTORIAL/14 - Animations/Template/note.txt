In order to enable animations, we need to update index.html,
    loading the necessary dependencies (angular-animate.js and jquery.js)
    and the files that contain the CSS and JavaScript code used in CSS/JavaScript animations.
The animation module, ngAnimate, contains the code necessary to make your application "animation aware".

Important: Be sure to use jQuery version 2.1 or newer,
    when using AngularJS 1.5 or newer; jQuery 1.x is not officially supported.
In order for AngularJS to detect jQuery and take advantage of it,
    make sure to include jquery.js before angular.js.

Animations can now be created within the CSS code (app.animations.css) as well as the JavaScript code (app.animations.js).
