Replace the ngSrc directive with a plain old src attribute. Using tools such as your browser's developer tools or inspecting the web server access logs, confirm that the application is indeed making an extraneous request to %7B%7Bphone.imageUrl%7D%7D (or {{phone.imageUrl}}).

The issue here is that the browser will fire a request for that invalid image address as soon as it hits the <img> tag, which is before AngularJS has a chance to evaluate the expression and inject the valid address.
