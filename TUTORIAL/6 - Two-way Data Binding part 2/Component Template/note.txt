We made the following changes to the phone-list.template.html template:

First, we added a <select> element bound to $ctrl.orderProp, so that our users can pick from the two provided sorting options.


We then chained the filter filter with the orderBy filter to further process the input for the repeater. orderBy is a filter that takes an input array, copies it and reorders the copy which is then returned.
AngularJS creates a two way data-binding between the select element and the $ctrl.orderProp model. $ctrl.orderProp is then used as the input for the orderBy filter.
As we discussed in the section about data-binding and the repeater in step 5, whenever the model changes (for example because a user changes the order with the select drop-down menu), AngularJS's data-binding will cause the view to automatically update. No bloated DOM manipulation code is necessary!
