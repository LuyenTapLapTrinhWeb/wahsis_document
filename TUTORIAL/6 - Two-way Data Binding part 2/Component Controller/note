We modified the phones model - the array of phones - and added an age property to each phone record. This property is used to order the phones by age.
We added a line to the controller that sets the default value of orderProp to age. If we had not set a default value here, the orderBy filter would remain uninitialized until the user picked an option from the drop-down menu.
This is a good time to talk about two-way data-binding. Notice that when the application is loaded in the browser, "Newest" is selected in the drop-down menu. This is because we set orderProp to 'age' in the controller. So the binding works in the direction from our model to the UI. Now if you select "Alphabetically" in the drop-down menu, the model will be updated as well and the phones will be reordered. That is the data-binding doing its job in the opposite direction â€” from the UI to the model.
