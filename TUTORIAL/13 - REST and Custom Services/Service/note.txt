We create our own service to provide access to the phone data on the server.
We will put the service in its own module,
under core,
so we can explicitly declare its dependency on ngResource:

We used the module API to register a custom service using a factory function.
We passed in the name of the service — 'Phone' — and the factory function.
The factory function is similar to a controller's constructor in that both can declare dependencies to be injected via function arguments.
The Phone service declares a dependency on the $resource service, provided by the ngResource module.

The $resource service makes it easy to create a RESTful client with just a few lines of code.
This client can then be used in our application, instead of the lower-level $http service.

We need to add the core.phone module as a dependency of the core module.
